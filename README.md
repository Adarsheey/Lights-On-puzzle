Lights Out is a puzzle game where you are presented with a grid of lights.
Some lights are turned on and some are off. The goal is to turn all the lights off by clicking on them.
However, clicking a light also toggles its neighbors (up, down, left, right).
You need to think carefully and plan your moves, because each click affects multiple lights.
The game challenges your logic and problem-solving skills while providing a fun and interactive experience.
You also have a limited number of moves to solve the puzzle, making it even more exciting!
